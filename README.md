- 👋 Hi, I’m @VoloJon
- 👀 I’m interested in Data Analytics projects such as Data cleaning, visualization, and basically anything in the data science lifecycle.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning R, Python, SQL, and a bit of C# scripting for Unity game development. I am in a Data Science certificate program and am just about to complete the program, with the final course being data mining.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on data science or analytics projects. Using tidyverse and developing SQL skills.
